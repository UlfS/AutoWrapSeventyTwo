# A well formed git commit message should be within 72 columns for a few reasons:
# 
# (From http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
#
# -- git log doesn’t do any special special wrapping of the commit
#    messages. With the default pager of less -S, this means your paragraphs
#    flow far off the edge of the screen, making them difficult to read. On
#    an 80 column terminal, if we subtract 4 columns for the indent on the
#    left and 4 more for symmetry on the right, we’re left with 72
#    columns.
# -- git format-patch --stdout converts a series of commits to a series of
#    emails, using the messages for the message body. Good email netiquette
#    dictates we wrap our plain text emails such that there’s room for a
#    few levels of nested reply indicators without overflow in an 80 column
#    terminal. (The current rails.git workflow doesn’t include email, but
#    who knows what the future will bring.)
#
# This script looks at each commit that is about to be pushed and adds new 
# line characters as necessary.
