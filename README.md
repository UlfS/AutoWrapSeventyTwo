AutoWrap
========

A Git Commit hook for automatically wrapping all commit messages to 72 characters

Step 1) Copy the script auto-wrap-72-char.py to <Your Git Repo>/.git/hooks
Step 2) Add the following lines to <Your Git Repo>/.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample:

```bash
if [ "$GITAUTOWRAP" = "true" ]; then
	exec < /dev/tty
	.git/hooks/auto-wrap-72-char.py $1
fi
```

Step 3) Rename this file to commit-msg to enable the hook.

Step 4) Add an environment variable called GITAUTOWRAP and set its value to "true". 

VoilÃ ! Now your commit messages will be automatically formatted such that no line exceeds 72 characters. Exception: URLs or other long strings that are more than 72 characters wide (since these cannot be broken up)

Existing line breaks are left as-is, as are any lines that are less than 72 characters long.
